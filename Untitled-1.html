    Almost every programming language has some basic or primary purpose. Depending on where you want to work, choosing the right language can improve your motivation to study and make your future job search easier. And here it is not necessary to look for which programming language is the easiest for a beginner to learn.

    More and more often the reason for learning programming - the desire to create applications for mobile systems such as Android, iOS or Windows Phone. And the choice of which programming language to learn is primarily determined by the mobile platform for which we want to create applications.

    The desire to write programs (or so-called desktop applications for desktop systems) is probably one of the most common reasons for learning a programming language. The most popular languages ​​among desktop application programmers are C and C #. And it is necessary to begin with the study of these languages ​​in the first place.

    Embedded systems, microprocessor and microcontroller programming are IT areas that are becoming more popular day by day. Embedded systems are a type of computer system designed to perform a specific task. Nowadays, you can find them almost everywhere: from all kinds of home appliances and electronics to the most sophisticated industrial machines.
</p>
<p>
    Programming of such systems is most often performed using JAVA, C / C and C #. The most popular platforms for beginners are Arduino and Raspberry Pi. The use of software platforms is limited only by the imagination. In the video below, you can see using an Arduino to create a robot that detects interference.
